## [[Omar-Akkor]] Catch Up 
Workplace of the Future:
[[Sandrine-Prioux]] has ~45 reports. We should try to be the same day at the office (e.g. Tue-Wed-Thu)
For now, I need to identify my future regular interlocutors
I will work on 5 Axes/Programs:

1.  CreditLens Migration (from Lending Cloud)
The idea is to migrate our Lending Cloud customers to CreditLens by 2022. This is US centric.
How many customers are there? When should we do that? Are they any product gaps between LC and CL?
[[Glen-Wordekemper]] ([[Emil-Lopez]]) has already looked at it. I should contact him.

2.  Banking Cloud Migration
All RFO clients?
Quid ALM?

3.  Standardization
[[Jil-Coppersmith]], [[Sébastien-Ilhe]]
Work with them to simplify our products, focus on CreditLens:
-   Workflow out of the box.
-   Default currency when starting application
-   Simplify CL configuration
I should define User Cases with them

4.  CTO/SIO Pitch
SaaS sales will happen with CTO/CIO. I need to prepare a deck to pitch our value prop (cost, speed, …)

5.  FINTECH
Which innovation bring to our products?
End 2023: the goal is to not deliver services anymore, all done with Partners (see [[Marie-Lehmann]])
