## [[Omar-Akkor]] Catch Up 
[[Zuraidah-Zaid]] will take care of Cross Selling, Internal and External integration
I will take care of SaaS migration:
-   Lending Cloud to CreditLens:
	-   [[Glen-Wordekemper]] works on missing features between LC and CreditLens
	-   I should work on strategic technical pitch to CTO/CRO
-   We will work with Rocket Insight. They do sprints (4-5 days sprints)
-   The UI of CreditLens is to be improved. For instance, in the US, they only use the facility screen they do not need 10+ screens of Deal Structuring
-   MA IQ (?): get and use data from our customers to build KPIâ€¦
-   Rabobank: do we have specific templates for Agriculture?
	-   Check with Nick Lacey
-   [[Brian-Wietecha]] works with [[Jil-Coppersmith]], on CL US Implementation
-   No Services in 3 years, the plan is:
	-   Standardization
	-   Go offshore
	-   Partners
-   CL on Prem: identify on prem clients and is there a saas migration strategy?
